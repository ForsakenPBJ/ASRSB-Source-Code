# ASRSB-Source-Code

# Inspiration
My dearest teacher who suggested this as a point of leverage for my role of QM in ASRSB, and it actually worked, so to kill two birds with one stone, I've decided to just make this.

# What it does
Currently, it does a plethora of things for the average user, such as letting students apply for instrument loaning, reporting defects, applying for absence, and checking their records and the future of the band.

# Challenges encountered
I dove in headfirst into this project without knowing anything about how I was going to organise it, using replit of all places to code (a big mistake if you're using sqlite3). I eventually mastered using jinja and linking it into html just from the sheer amount of issues I faced with the code and trying to get the inputs to work correctly.

# How it's built
It was built frontend to backend, then top to down. I developed the gist of what I wanted the CSS to be, and slowly expanded from there for all the html designs (using chatGPT to facilitate some of the styling, but ultimately still heavily reliant on my code). It was designed in such a way that I conserved the school's colors while not making it look TOO ugly. After all the frontend was complete I moved on to the backend, which has caused me many hours of sleep, with various issues on linking up variables. I was planning to use a bunch of csvs to store my file but eventually decided on using a database, which I did not add on to here.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud off
To date, this is the biggest computing project I have taken on, and I am amazed that I have not given up on it yet (looking at you, ShogiBoard). Maybe it's because I had promised my peers and teachers about the website. Otherwise, I probably would be here doing this without a commitee role.

# What I have learned
This journey has made me question my life decisions, but if we are talking purely about code, I have mastered SQL functions through my endeavor with this project, and am able to use DB browser with ease. I also learnt about hashing and salting passwords, alongside flask.session. Otherwise, the countless nights of staring into my dim screen trying to debug code have made me learn to sleep more, and made me discover my love for sleep.

# What's next for ASRSB Website
An absolute myriad of things I have planned I could not implement soon enough without sacrificing my physical, mental, and spiritual health. Some of the bigger aspects include sheet music links, a calendar, more background pictures, not to mention all the admin powers, as currently people are requesting me to store data in files to wait for approval (I really wanted just to link it up to the database directly, but whatever). The next challenge I'll face is making it user friendly to the admins who will be also running this website.
